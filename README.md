This is a web application, developed with spring-mvc, bootstrap and Jquery to implement a very simple and basic social network, where people can create some channels or join them to see what others have been shared or vice versa..

Rules are simple:
1)Every channel is public for visiting and joining by every user, but only the channel's admin can upload posts.
2)posts has only two parts: A title and a URl (admin would enter a title and a URL, and system would find the the best image in that URL and the goal is to show that image to channel's subscribers)

as you may have been noticed, this is a social media that crawls URLs to find images..
